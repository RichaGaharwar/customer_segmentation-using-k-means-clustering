# customer_segmentation-using-k-means-clustering
Customer segmentation is the business strategy of dividing a market into customer groups with shared characteristics, while clustering is the machine learning technique used to discover these groups in data by finding naturally occurring patterns. Clustering provides the data-driven insights to inform and execute customer segmentation, but segmentation is the broader business goal of using those groups to create targeted marketing efforts. 

Customer segmentation:
  What it is: 
  The strategic process of dividing customers into distinct groups based on shared characteristics, behaviors, or needs to create tailored marketing strategies.
  How it's done: 
  Typically involves a business deciding on specific criteria, such as demographics (age, income, location) or behaviors, and then manually or systematically assigning customers to those predefined     groups.
  Why it's used: 
  To create more relevant experiences for customers by developing targeted products, services, and marketing messages for each group. 

Clustering:
  What it is: 
  An unsupervised machine learning technique that analyzes data to identify natural groupings and patterns without predefined criteria.
  How it's done: 
  Algorithms like K-means automatically group data points based on their similarities, revealing hidden relationships that might not be obvious.
  Why it's used: 
  To discover new, data-driven customer segments and understand underlying user behaviors, which can then be used for segmentation. 

Tools used: SQL, product analytics, Python, Unsupervised ML algorithm.
